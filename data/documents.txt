Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models.
Natural language processing enables computers to understand and process human language.
Information retrieval systems help users find relevant documents from large collections.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.
Search engines index web pages and rank them based on relevance to user queries.
Text mining extracts useful information from unstructured text data.
Topic modeling discovers hidden topics in document collections.
Query expansion improves search results by adding related terms to queries.
Ranking algorithms determine the order of search results.
Semantic search understands the meaning of queries beyond keyword matching.
Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise.
Vector spaces represent documents and queries as numerical vectors.
Term frequency measures how often a word appears in a document.
Inverse document frequency measures how rare a word is across documents.
TF-IDF combines term frequency and inverse document frequency for weighting.
BM25 is a ranking function used in information retrieval systems.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a topic modeling technique.
K-means clustering groups similar documents together.
Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors in continuous space.
GloVe is an algorithm for learning word embeddings from global statistics.
